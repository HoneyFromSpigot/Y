   	"Recipe's not displaying properly":
   		Recipes would not display, and instead said invalid recipe

   		[Resolution]:
   			In the showRecipe(player, itemstack, recipeNum) method I changed the > 0 check to a >= 0, because the first element in the list would be 0, not 1. This was causing recipes to not show.

   	'BuyPremium Command - Constant database error':
   		The buy-premium command constantly complains there's a database error.

   		[Resoultion]:
   			Simplified the logic behind the asyncronous task execution,re-wrote the sql statements used in handling the adding and removing, and removed the boolean return from updatePlayerPremium in the server database connector, along with made it throw an exception to be handled from the callable.
	
	'Ban Command - Time Argument':
		For the longest time, when banning a player, after
		the t: argument it would no longer take the ban message.

		[Resolution]:
			Replaced the for-loops 'break;' statement
			with a 'continue;' statement. It doesn't kill
			the loop that way ;)
