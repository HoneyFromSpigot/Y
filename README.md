# Y Project
## What is the YProject?

The YProject is a project aimed at pushing the boundaries of Minecraft plugins. It serves as a library for developers, offering various useful tools such as a command system, a GUI system, a Firework API, a Title API, and much more. 
A detailed list of features can be found [here](https://github.com/TheWebcode/Y/tree/main#features). 
However, the YProject is not merely a collection of libraries; it goes beyond that. 
It is a mod that adds additional features to the server. While it is not mandatory for players to install this mod, it does bring several benefits (the requirement of the mod can be adjusted in the server settings). 
With the Y Mod installed, players have the ability to log into the server settings using "/login" and their corresponding password (configurable in the server configuration). 
The Y Mod also introduces additional features such as KeyPressEvents (for developers) and custom GUIs.
